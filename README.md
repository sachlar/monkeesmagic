# monkeymagic

The monkeymagic website project is a static front end only website for legendary
rock band "The Monkeys". The band was born in the 1960's, and have 50 years of 
rock legacy under their belts. 

Live performances, studio performances, multiple record deals with different 
labels, many albums recorded.

## UX

Who is the site for? 
The site is for the existing and potential new fans.

What do they want to achieve? 
They want to reach their audiences with their 
music from their back catalog and surface any new material to them. They also 
want to showcase the music and their availability to perform at certain events like 
weddings and parties. In addition to music they wish to showcase video clips and 
photos.

How will the site satisfy the client requirements?
The site will enable users to listen to music, see video clips and view photgraphs.
The site will provide a contact form to allow users to outline their requirements for 
performances and the dates they want the band to play.
The site will include links to their social media pages across facebook, twitter
and youtube.

THE USER STORIES

1. As a user existing fan I want to (Listen to backcatalog music) this because I am a lifelong fan and love the old stuff
2. As a user existing fan I want to (Watch videos of the band) as a lifelong fan I love them
3. As a user existing fan I want to (watch out for new music) as a lifelong fan I love the old stuff but I also like their new stuff too
4. As a user existing fan I want to (Look at photos of the band) as a lifelong fan I like to remind myself of some of their key career moments
5. As a user existing fan I want to (Folow the band on social media) this because as a lifelong fan i want to see what they are up to and watch out for new tours dates or shows
6. As a user I might be a new fan I want to (Listen to backcatalog music) this because I want to see what they are all about and like music from back in the 60's
7. As a user I am not a fan but my relative is, I want to enquire if they are available to to a party appearance / show for them

The site needs to have a clear, clean modern feel to draw in new curious fans but have content that helps the lifelong fan to relieve memories and experiences over the decade
